    <p>
      React, or ReactJS, is a declarative JavaScript library designed as an efficient, flexible route to building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook, instagram and a community of independent developers and businesses. It is open source and provides out of the box developer tools. 
    </p>
    <p>
      React offers the possibility of creating rich web applications delivering a fast and efficient experience. The basic idea is that components inform React about what you want to render. React will update and render only those components when your data changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      React is often described in the same way as other Javascript frameworks but this is really misleading. <strong>React and Angular are not directly comparable entities.</strong> Where Angular is a complete framework, React is not. React is a declarative, flexible Javascript Library used to deal <strong>exclusively with Views</strong> â€” the output of information.
