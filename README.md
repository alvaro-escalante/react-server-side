##React Server Side Rendering
=============================

Quick start
-----------

###React Server Side Rendering with React router and and Express server

- To run development mode first start express server by running `npm start` the in another terminal tab run `gulp --dev`
- To build for production `gulp built`
- 

###To run on the server â€“ Nginx

- Install Node and babel-cli
- Edit server block to /app:

```
  proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
  proxy_http_version 1.1;
  proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
  proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
  proxy_set_header Host $host;
  proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
```

###CSS

- Use lowercase and hyphens for class names
- Newline for each style property and classname
- Don't use IDs for class names
- Don't use !important
- Use names based on structure, not presentation e.g. btn-primary not btn-green
- Don't qualify class names with attribute types e.g. .well, not div.well 
- Include a comment where a selector is included for a specific, not immediately obvious reason
- Write CSS in a modular way if possible, assume that any element could be included anywhere on the site
- Try to avoid excessive class hierarchy such as .basket .summar .details .product .description .price {color:#FF000;}
- Don't use page specific classes
- Apply styles using a class name rather than an element name (except for base styles)
- Styles for a specific purpose should be grouped together, not scattered e.g. media queries, browser specific styles

###JavaScript

- JS should interact with the DOM using either element IDs, data* attributes or class names that have no styles associated with them, and use the naming convention js-classname, to make it really obvious that they are used only by the JavaScript
- use braces with all multiline blocks
- every function should have a comment that briefly explains what it does
- name functions and variables descriptively
- camelcase for objects, functions and instances

Remember SEO

- Page meta tags including og and any related extra stuff
- Image alt tags
- Correct heading structure
- Semantic markup
- CSS, JS etc. should be minified
- Image sizes should be optimised
- Overall page size should ideally be less than 2MB!


Use of Gulp
------------

There is a `gulpfile.js` within this repository to make development much quicker for the house styles. All you need to do is:

- Install Node (http://nodejs.org) & Gulp (https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)
- Run `npm run setup`

This will install all the dependencies found in `package.json` (The `node_modules` folder that is generated when you run this command should be created on a case-by-case basis and not pushed to a repository), install the Bower dependencies found in `package.json` and run the local server through the `gulp` command.

Note for Windows users with Git Bash: you may need to run 'npm run setup' a couple of times for it to finally work.
  
This will open up a tab in your browser, running a server at `localhost:3000` (unless you have set up a proxy server address - details on how to change this are in the `gulpfile.js` file).

### BrowserSync
  
The main component of this Gulp setup is BrowserSync. This plugin provides the following advantages for development:  
* Simultaneous page scrolling for all devices connected to the same link  
* Clicking links or populating form fields on one device will duplicate this behaviour on all other linked devices  
* A dashboard at `localhost:3001` where you can send commands to all connected devices, perform actions and do network throttle testing.
